Login to Google Cloud Compute Engine SSH
	https://stackoverflow.com/a/57087567
		Easiest way for creating and using one pair of ssh keys for multiple instances:
		Step 1: Install putty and puttyGen from https://putty.org/
		Step 2: Open a terminal in your local desktop / laptop (in Windows 10 and later you use Windows Linux Subsystem)
		Type: ssh-keygen
		Enter a name for the filename at the prompt: e.g. google_key
		2 files will be created google_key and google_key.pub
		Step 3: Copy the entire contents of the google_key.pub
		Note there is no new line character. It should all be in one line.
		Step 4: Before creating any VM instance, go to Compute Engine -> Metadata
		Select "SSH keys" tab and click "Add SSH" keys
		Paste the contents of the google_key.pub. If you pasted the contents properly, you should see the username appear on the left label. Then hit save.
		Step 5: Now create your favorite VM instance under google compute.
		Copy the External IP vm_instance_external_ip
		Go back to your linux terminal and type
		ssh -i google_key.pub username@vm_instance_external_ip
		Type "yes"
		And now you should be good to go.

Getting a CORS error in browser related to a missing Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in response from storage.googleapis.com
	You should publish the CORS file to your Google Cloud Storage bucket using `D:\web\xny\ticketsarabia> gcloud storage buckets update gs://ticketsarabia_staging --cors-file=google_cloud_storage_cors.json`

	Here are the details https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-cors#command-line_1

Google Cloud errors Domain Restricted Sharing when trying to make a bucket public
	In order to still allow specific Cloud Run services being invokeable by allUsers when a DRS policy is in place, platform administrators could disable the DRS policy, set an IAM policy including allUsers and finally enable the DRS policy again.
