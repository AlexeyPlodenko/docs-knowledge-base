1. Generate the Key on your Droplet
Log into your DigitalOcean Droplet via SSH and run this command:

Bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy@yourapp.com"


When asked where to save: Press Enter to use the default (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519).
When asked for a passphrase: Press Enter twice (leave it empty so the deployment can run automatically).
2. Add the Public Key to GitHub
You need to tell GitHub that this specific Droplet is allowed to access your repository.
Copy the Public Key: Run this command on your Droplet to show the key:
  
Bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Go to GitHub: Navigate to your specific Repository.
Settings: Click on Settings > Deploy keys (in the left sidebar).
Add deploy key:
Title: Name it something like DigitalOcean Droplet.
Key: Paste the string you copied (it should start with ssh-ed25519).
Allow write access: Leave this unchecked (for security, the server only needs to read/pull code).

3. Test the Connection
Back on your Droplet, run this command to make sure GitHub recognizes the key:

Bash
ssh -T git@github.com


Note: You might see a warning about the authenticity of the host. Type yes and press Enter. If successful, you’ll see: “Hi [YourRepo]! You've successfully authenticated...”

4. Update your Workflow (The SSH Key)
For your GitHub Action to work, you actually need a different key than the one above.
The Deploy Key (created above): Stays on the Droplet so the Droplet can talk to GitHub.
The SSH Secret (for the Action): This is a key that allows GitHub Actions to talk to the Droplet.
If you haven't already, generate a second key pair on your local machine or Droplet to use for the SSH_PRIVATE_KEY secret in GitHub:
Put the Public part of this second key into the Droplet's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
Put the Private part of this second key into GitHub Secrets (under SSH_PRIVATE_KEY).
Quick Troubleshooting
Permission Denied: Ensure the file permissions on the Droplet are correct:
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Wrong User: If you generated the key as root but your app lives under a user named www-data, make sure that user has access to the keys.
